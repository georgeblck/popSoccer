## Inspiration

[This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/9xvggj/oc_does_a_nations_population_size_predict_the/ "Reddit Link") on reddit was used as inspiration for this body of work.
The author tries to show the relationship between a nations population and the performance of its soccer team. I like the idea but see some errors that I wanted to correct:

1. The FIFA points ranking is a bad measure of a soccer teams actual strength [(Source)](http://lasek.rexamine.com/football_rankings.pdf "Source"). Measures like Elo-rating should be used **and are used** by more sophisticated writers (e.g. 538). 
2. An average of soccer performance should be used (e.g. Average ELO rating of the last 10 years), not a point measurement in time. 
3. The line at 1 million strikes and the coloured bubbles strike me as 100% arbitrary. If anything, a simple clustering algorithm should be used to determine appropriate clusters (e.g. k-means).

## Results

### Using recent Elo Ratings

First, let us have a look at this graph if we use the World Soccer Elo Rating of December 2017 (pre WorldCup):
```{r simpleElo17, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE,dpi=300,out.width = "1000px"}
source("readData.R")
ggplot(eloPop, aes(PopTotal, elo17)) + geom_point() + theme_tufte(ticks = F) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", breaks = 100 * 
                                                             (10^(1:7)), labels = comma)+
  geom_smooth()+annotate("text", x = c(1000), y = c(1900), adj=0,  family="serif",
           label = c("Elo Rating of Dec. 2017\nand Population (log-Scale)\n"))
cor.test(eloPop$elo17, eloPop$PopTotal, method = "kendall")
```
We see a much clearer positive correlation between Population and Performance, althoug it fizzes out a both ends of population.

What happens when we insert the countries names
```{r simpleElo17Names, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE,dpi=300,out.width = "1000px"}
ggplot(eloPop, aes(PopTotal, elo17, label = Name)) + geom_text(size=1.5) + theme_tufte(ticks = F) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", breaks = 100 * 
                                                             (10^(1:7)), labels = comma)+
  geom_smooth()+annotate("text", x = c(1000), y = c(1900), adj=0,  family="serif",
           label = c("Elo Rating of Dec. 2017\nand Population (log-Scale)\n"))
```
No we can easily recognize the outliers

* Better than expected: Iceland, Portugal, Germany, Brazil
* Worse than expected: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India

Iceland and Portugal are the best examples: two small countries that have performed suprisingly well in recent years. 

### Using average Elo Ratings

The two positive outliers show, that the graphic is biased on nations that have performed well only in recent years. So let us know look at the Average Elo-Rating:

```{r simpleEloAvg, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE,dpi=300,out.width = "1000px"}
ggplot(eloPop, aes(PopTotal, avgElo, label = Name)) + geom_text(size=1.5) + theme_tufte(ticks = F) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", breaks = 100 * 
                                                             (10^(1:7)), labels = comma)+
  geom_smooth()+annotate("text", x = c(1000), y = c(1900), adj=0,  family="serif",
           label = c("Avg Elo Rating\nand Population (log-Scale)\n"))
cor.test(eloPop$avgElo, eloPop$PopTotal, method = "kendall")
```

The correlation stays the same, but we see different outliers:

* Better than expected: Urugay, Croatia, Scotland
* Worse than expected: 

This also makes sense, as Urugay and Croatia are historically better teams than Iceland & Portugal. 

## Using more Information

### Life Expectancy

What happens when we add more Information to the simple plot

```{r lifeElo17, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, dpi=300,out.width = "1000px"}
ggplot(eloPopLife, aes(x=PopTotal, y=elo17,label=ccode)) + geom_text(aes(color=LEx), size=3) + theme_tufte(ticks = F) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", breaks = 100 * 
                                                             (10^(1:7)), labels = comma)+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)+
  scale_color_jcolors_contin("pal3")+annotate("text", x = c(1000), y = c(2000), adj=0,  family="serif",
           label = c("Dec2017 Elo Rating, Population (log)\nand Life Expectancy"))
cor.test(eloPopLife$elo17, eloPopLife$LEx, method = "kendall")
cor.test(eloPopLife$PopTotal, eloPopLife$LEx, method = "kendall")
```
We see that it helps somewhat. Life Expectancy is not correlated with Population but **is** positively correlated with Elo-Rating. 

* Nations above the smoothing line seem to have a higher life expectancy (notable exception: Nigeria, Cameroon)
* Nations below the line seem to have a lower life expectancy (notable exceptions: Taiwan, Hongkong, Singapore). 

### Social Progress Index

We see the same pattern when we use a different measure for the quality of life in a nation:

```{r spiElo17, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, dpi=300,out.width = "1000px"}
ggplot(eloPopSPI, aes(x=PopTotal, y=elo17,label=ccode)) + geom_text(aes(color=SocialProgressIndex), size=3) + theme_tufte(ticks = F) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", breaks = 100 * 
                                                             (10^(1:7)), labels = comma)+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)+
  scale_color_jcolors_contin("pal3")+annotate("text", x = c(1000), y = c(2000), adj=0,  family="serif",
           label = c("Dec2017 Elo Rating, Population (log)\nand Social Progress Index"))
cor.test(eloPopSPI$elo17, eloPopSPI$SocialProgressIndex, method = "kendall")
cor.test(eloPopSPI$PopTotal, eloPopSPI$SocialProgressIndex, method = "kendall")
```
